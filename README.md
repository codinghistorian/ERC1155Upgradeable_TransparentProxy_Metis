ERC20Upgradeable using Transparent Project is deployed on Metis Testnet ChainID:666

Contract Address of BibimbeatERC20V2 is 0x04dBCbafba943Be87f01C0E29CEd94C5A561Be55

Had to get rid of OVM. The official docs was quite outdated so got help from the Hackathon Dev Support Telegram chat room.

ERC1155 and the Market Logic also needs to be deployed. 

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
